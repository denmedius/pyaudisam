# Extract from Distance software documentation (http://distancesampling.org/):
# the following was copied and pasted from the 2nd table of .chm documentation,
# "MCDS Engine Stats File" page, and then fixed as such:
# * With Distance 7.3 = MCDS 6.2
#   - Module 1 / Statistic 4: added missing reference to note 1 at the end,
#   - Module 2 / Statistic 101...100+N: changed "of each parameter" to "of each adjustment term parameter",
#   - Module 4 : Abudance => Abundance.
# * With Distance 7.5 = MCDS 7.4, new fixes:
#   - Module 2 / Statistic 18, 19, 20*, 21*, 22* : added because undocumented (* => multiple instances, like for Statistic 3).
# Beware when editing: '–' are not '-' below !
